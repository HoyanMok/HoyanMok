### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hoyan Mok.
I can speak **Chinese**, **Cantonese**, **Japanese** and **English**. 

I am learning **Haskell**, **Julia** and **C** (revise!).

I am about to do ...
* Update my study notes on math.
* Learn computational physics and write `ComputPhysics` just for practice.
* Learn Linux

I am currently busying preparing for an important exam, after that maybe I will have time to do these.
